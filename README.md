### From Chaosia Eraro: Hello!

I'm one of the employees of Ringo in RL corp. People there likes to call me Chaos because... well, it's my name.
Hobbies include drinking, video games (especially party games) and researching.
Favorite food being alcohol, even though I can't really get drunk...?
Least favorite food being anything plain.
Currectly working on Erasophobia Experiment, direct by Ringo and Lumina, which turns the simulated world of ours into an action game.
Former nihilist, now I just doesn't care lmao.
Fun Fact: I knew my world is a simulation even before Ringo, that's surprising.

If you want to reach me, you probably can't, I'm in a simulation. You could possibly see me in an action game if the Erasophobia Experiment went successfully.

Peace, Chaosia Eraro


P.S from the Creator:
The bio above is a character from an indie game I'm making, if you're interested in helping me or giving me ideas, I'm free for anyone friendly.
